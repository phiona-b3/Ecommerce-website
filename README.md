# Hi, I'm Phiona! ðŸ‘‹
Here is my final portfolio project at ALX.

# Ecommerce Store

This website is desgned to enable the users purchase hair products for their natural hair.

The user can add the products to or remove them from the cart and also make real payments with stripe, have free shipping or at a specified cost.

It uses sanity as the backend so the owner of the site does not need to go back to the code in order to make changes in product availbailty, or new products. She can do it directly in sanity.
All the backend development is handled by sanity.
